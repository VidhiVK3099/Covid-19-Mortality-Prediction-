## COVID-19 Mortality Prediction from Past Data Using R

#### Overview
This project aims to predict COVID-19 mortality rates based on past data. The prediction model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze factors such as the effect of vaccination over time, Pearson's Correlation Heatmap, and COVID-19 statistics to forecast mortality rates in different regions.

#### Motivation
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to global healthcare systems. Predicting mortality rates accurately can aid policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in implementing targeted interventions, resource allocation, and preparedness planning to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

#### Data Sources
Historical COVID-19 data is from Data on COVID-19 by Our World in Data, World Health Organization (WHO).
